    <h2><li>
        The Samy Worm (2005)
    </li></h2>
    <img src = "myspace.jpg" width = 400>

        <p>Samy Kamkar was a 19 year old MySpace user who created one of the fastest spreading computer viruses ever. He created a code that made anyone who viewed his profile have a message across the screen that displayed "Samy is my Hero". After only 20 hours, he had accumilated over 1 million friends which caused myspace to crash and go offline for several hours in order to clear the worm. Kamkar was raided by the secret service and sentenced to three years of probation with no inernet access.</p>

    <h2><li>
        The Heartbleed Bug (2014)
    </li></h2>
    <img src = "bleed.png" width = 400>
        <p>The Heartbleed bug was a critical security flaw found in OpenSSL, the encryption software used by millions of websites to keep user data private. It was a "buffer over-read" vulnerability caused by a simple coding error: the software failed to verify the size of a data request before responding. This allowed attackers to trick a server into "bleeding" out chunks of its system memory, which often contained sensitive information like private encryption keys, passwords, and session cookies. Because the exploit left no trace in server logs, it was considered one of the most dangerous vulnerabilities in the history of the modern internet.

    <h2><li>
        The British Airways Data Breach (2018)
    </h2></li>
    <img src = "ba.webp" width = 400>
        <p>In 2018, British Airways (BA) suffered a major data breach when the Magecart hacking group injected 22 lines of malicious JavaScript into its website and mobile app. This "digital skimmer" captured the personal and financial details of approximately 429,612 customers in real-time as they made bookings. The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) later found that BA had failed to implement basic security measures, such as multi-factor authentication and encryption for administrator credentials, leading to a record-breaking £20 million GDPR fine</p>

    <h2><li>
        The Ticketmaster "Magecart" Breach (2018)
    </h2></li>
    <img src = "ticketmaster.jpg" width = 400>
        <p>Ticketmaster fell victim to a digital skimming campaign. In this case, the attackers did not hack Ticketmaster directly; instead, they compromised a third-party chatbot service (Inbenta) used on the payment page. By injecting malicious JavaScript into that chatbot, hackers were able to "scrape" the credit card details and personal information of roughly 40,000 customers as they typed them in. This highlighted the extreme danger of third-party scripts running on sensitive payment pages, a direct parallel to how BA’s website was compromised.</p>

    <h2><li>
        The Yahoo Data Breach (2013)
    </h2></li>
    <img src = "yahoo.jpg" width = 400>
        <p>The Yahoo data breaches remain the largest in history, ultimately compromising all 3 billion user accounts through a series of attacks between 2013 and 2014. The fallout involved the theft of names, hashed passwords, and birthdates, along with a sophisticated state-sponsored attack that used forged cookies to bypass security without needing passwords. Because Yahoo delayed public disclosure until years later, the company's acquisition price by Verizon was slashed by $350 million, and they were forced to pay a record $35 million fine to the SEC for failing to properly inform investors. Today, the incident serves as a landmark case for the necessity of transparent disclosure and the massive financial consequences of poor incident response.
